**PAPER ONLY — no real transactions.**

PROVISIONAL PAPER ACCOUNTING, not executable fills or realized profit. Exact quoted token quantities are retained. Entry cash adds 1% or 3% plus 0.05 USDC; exit cash subtracts the same scenario percentage plus 0.05 USDC. These are extra cost stresses, not measured slippage or additional AMM fees. No transaction, latency-fill, market-impact, full-route or token-extension execution validation. Alternatives share observations; never sum their P&L. Open positions have unknown liquidation value; book equity holds them at cost. Failed exits retain locked capital and position slots. Quality checks never retroactively remove trades. Model times are quote receipt times; bookkeeping may occur later. No earlier quote records are backfilled into this pilot.

Primary predeclared account: **E60_H900_C100** (60-second entry, 15-minute horizon, 1% extra cost per side).
Each row is a separate $500 account, not a slice of one portfolio. No profit-based model selection.

Open holdings are not marked as profits. Liquidation equity and market drawdown remain unknown while unmeasured.
Missing exits are not deleted from the denominator: see open and unresolved counts alongside closed-only statistics.
The authoritative ledger is accounts.sqlite3. ledger.csv is a rebuildable export with source quote hashes.
Collector research observations are never rewritten by this paper layer.
